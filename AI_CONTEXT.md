## 1. Project Overview

OliveERP is a comprehensive, modular Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system built with Django and Wagtail CMS. It provides full double-entry accounting, inventory management, CRM/sales, purchasing/procurement, HR, project management, and tax compliance features with a modern Bootstrap-based UI.

**Target users**: Small to medium businesses requiring an all-in-one ERP solution with accounting, operations, and compliance capabilities.

**Development stage**: In-progress / MVP - core modules are functional but some areas (like accounting reporting) are being enhanced.

- **Frontend**: Django Templates, Bootstrap 5, **HTMX** (for partial page updates: bank reconciliation, live tax previews), Chart.js
- **Database**: MySQL (production) / SQLite (dev)
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis
- **Authentication**: Custom User model in `core/models.py`

## 3. Architecture & Key Design Decisions

### Architecture Pattern
- **Modular Monolith** - Django apps organized by business domain (finance, inventory, crm, hr, etc.)
- **MVC** - Models in each app, views in `views.py`, URLs in `urls.py`
- **Signal-driven** - Django signals for automated workflows (inventory updates, invoice generation)

### Folder Structure
```

├── static/                  # CSS, JS, images
├── wagtailerp/              # Django settings
```

### Key Design Decisions
- **Company Scoping**: Most modules scope data by `CompanyProfile` via ForeignKey
- **Custom User**: Uses `core.User` (extends AbstractUser) with optional company link
- **Navigation**: Generated via `core.context_processors.navigation_menu`
- **Accounting**: Uses `finance.Account`, `JournalEntry`, `JournalEntryLine` as source of truth
- **Accounting Extensions**: `apps.accounting/*` adds specialized features (fixed assets, bank reconciliation)
- **Custom Signals**: `finance/signals.py` defines `journal_entry_posted` signal for post-entry automation (budget updates, reconciliation status invalidation, VAT threshold checks)
- **Tax Engine Registry**: `tax_engine` uses registry pattern (`BaseTaxEngine`) for multi-country tax compliance

## 5. Current State

### ✅ Completed Features
- User authentication with custom User model
- Company profile with currencies
- Finance: Chart of accounts, journal entries, invoices
- Inventory: Products, warehouses, stock tracking
- CRM: Customers, sales orders
- HR: Employees, departments, leave, attendance

### 🔄 In-progress Features
- **Accounting module**: Being enhanced with better reporting, seed data, and compliance features
- **Test coverage**: Test discovery for `apps.accounting` module
- **Related party transactions**: Consolidation between two models in progress

### ❌ Not Yet Started
- Full audit trail implementation
- Multi-company support (current design is single-company per installation)
- Advanced workflow automation beyond signals
- API documentation

### Optional / Workarounds
- **Accounting seed data**: Use `python manage.py generate_sample_data` or `python manage.py reset_demo_data` to populate accounting tables (required after migrations on fresh DB)
- **Testing accounting**: Run tests with `python manage.py test apps.accounting.tests.test_models`
- **Multi-country tax**: The `tax_engine` uses registry pattern (`BaseTaxEngine`) - each country implements `ITaxEngine` interface

---

## 6. Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **Accounting tables missing**: `apps.accounting_*` tables don't exist in SQLite - need migrations for MySQL/PostgreSQL
   - Tables: `apps_accounting_fixedasset`, `apps_accounting_bankreconciliation`, etc.
   - Migrations exist but table creation may fail on SQLite

2. **Test discovery**: `manage.py test apps.accounting` fails due to module discovery issues
   - Workaround: Run specific test files with `python manage.py test apps.accounting.tests.test_models` or use `-m django test`

3. **Duplicate `get_user_company()` helper**: The helper is currently duplicated in:
   - `apps/accounting/reporting/views.py`
   - `apps/accounting/assets/views.py`
   - **Refactor suggestion**: Centralize in `core/utils.py`

4. **Duplicate RelatedPartyTransaction**: Two models exist:
   - `apps/accounting/compliance/models.py::RelatedPartyTransaction` (standalone)
   - `apps/accounting/related_party/models.py::RelatedPartyTransaction` (journal-linked)
   - Views query both but data should be consolidated

5. **Sample data company mismatch**: Old seed data creates "Olive Tech Solutions Ltd" but current user may be linked to "Nimra tech"
   - Use `manage.py reset_demo_data` to get clean dataset

## 7. Data Models & Key Entities

### Core Entities
- **User** (`core.User`) - Custom user with optional `company` FK
- **CompanyProfile** (`company.CompanyProfile`) - Singleton company settings, currency, VAT registration
- **Currency** (`company.Currency`) - Currency codes and exchange rates

### Finance Entities
- **Account** (`finance.Account`) - Chart of accounts with hierarchical structure
- **JournalEntry** (`finance.JournalEntry`) - Posted accounting transactions
- **JournalEntryLine** (`finance.JournalEntryLine`) - Individual debit/credit lines
- **Invoice** (`finance.Invoice`) - Customer invoices

### Inventory Entities
- **Product** (`inventory.Product`) - Product master with pricing
- **Warehouse** (`inventory.Warehouse`) - Storage locations
- **StockLevel** (`inventory.StockLevel`) - Current stock per product/warehouse
- **StockMovement** (`inventory.StockMovement`) - Stock history

### Accounting Extensions
- **FixedAsset** (`apps/accounting/assets/models.py`) - Asset tracking with depreciation
- **BankReconciliation** (`apps/accounting/reconciliation/models.py`) - Bank reconciliation periods
- **Dividend** (`apps/accounting/compliance/models.py`) - Dividend records
- **CT1Computation** (`apps/accounting/compliance/models.py`) - Corporation tax computation
- **ComplianceDeadline** (`apps/accounting/compliance/models.py`) - Compliance deadlines

### Tax Engine

- **TaxFiling** (`tax_engine/base/models.py`) - Tax filing records
- **BeneficialOwner** (`tax_engine/countries/ie/rbo.py`) - Irish RBO registrations

---

## 8. External Integrations & Environment

### Required Environment Variables
- `SECRET_KEY` - Django secret key
- `DEBUG` - Debug mode
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection for Celery
- `EMAIL_*` - Email configuration
- `WAGTAIL_*` - Wagtail settings

### Celery Beat Schedule
- Celery Beat schedules are defined in `wagtailerp/settings/base.py` under `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE`
- Example: daily invoice generation, nightly stock valuations

### Third-Party Services
- **Wagtail CMS** - Content management and admin panels
- **Chart.js** - Dashboard visualizations
- **HTMX** - Partial page updates
- **WeasyPrint/ReportLab** - PDF generation
- **Bootstrap 5** - UI framework

---

## 9. What NOT to Change

1. **Company scoping pattern**: Don't remove `company` FK from models - it's fundamental to multi-tenant design
2. **Account model**: `finance.Account` is the source of truth for accounting - don't duplicate
3. **Navigation via context processor**: `core.context_processors.navigation_menu` generates all nav items - modify there, not hardcoded
4. **Signal workflows**: `core/signals.py` handles automatic inventory/invoice updates - be careful modifying
5. **Custom User model**: Must use `core.User` - don't switch to default Django user
6. **Top navigation layout**: The new top-nav layout in `templates/base.html` should be preserved

---

## 10. Conventions & Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions
- **Models**: PascalCase (`CompanyProfile`, `JournalEntry`)
- **Views**: PascalCase with suffix (`ProfitAndLossView`, `FixedAssetListView`)
- **URL names**: `module:view_name` (e.g., `accounting:profit_loss`)
- **Templates**: lowercase with underscores (`profit_loss.html`)
- **CSS classes**: kebab-case (`.sidebar-container`, `.nav-module-link`)

### File Organization
- Models in `models.py`
- Views in `views.py`
- Forms in `forms.py`
- URLs in `urls.py`
- Admin in `admin.py`
- Templates in `app_name/template_path/`
- Static in `static/app_name/`

### Code Style
- Use `gettext_lazy` for translations
- Use `DecimalField` for money fields
- Include `created_at` and `updated_at` on all models
- Use `LoginRequiredMixin` on all views
- Type hints on public methods

## 11. Next Logical Steps

1. **Complete accounting module migrations**: Run migrations for `apps.accounting` on production database to create missing tables
2. **Consolidate RelatedPartyTransaction**: Choose one model as source of truth and migrate data
3. **Add more accounting forms/views**: Create forms for creating/editing fixed assets, dividends, etc.
4. **Improve test coverage**: Add more tests for `apps.accounting` and other modules
5. **API development**: Expose key entities via DRF for potential mobile/web apps
6. **Audit trail**: Implement full audit logging for financial transactions
